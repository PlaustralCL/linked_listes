# Linked Lists
The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with the linked list
data structure by making a class that can create a linked list. This is part
of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists).

## The LinkedList class has the following methods:

* #append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
* #prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
* #size returns the total number of nodes in the list
* #head returns the first node in the list
* #tail returns the last node in the list
* #at(index) returns the node at the given index
* #pop removes the last element from the list
* #contains?(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
* #find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.
* #to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format is be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil
